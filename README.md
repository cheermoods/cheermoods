Hello, you can call me Tantely. 

I hold a Master's degree in Communication and Digital Technology, and in 2024, I'm embarking on a career transition to become a front-end web developer. 
I am drawn to the field of web development because, above all, I am an artist. I love the world of creativity in various domains. Beyond that, I have a strong desire to bring my ideas to life and contribute to the realization of ideas presented to me. 
My goal is to be a proactive contributor and provide solid technical support in the professional world.
