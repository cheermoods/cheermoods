Hello, my name is Tantely.

I hold a Master's degree in Communication and Digital Technology. In 2024, I am embarking on a career transition to become a front-end web developer.

## Why Web Development?

What draws me to the field of web development is, above all, my artistic side. I love the world of creativity in various domains. Additionally, I have a strong desire to bring my ideas to life and contribute to the realization of ideas presented to me.

## My Goal

My goal is to be a proactive contributor and provide technical support in the professional world.

## Recruiter Test

function recruiterTest(action) {
    if (action === 'viewedProfile') {
        return "Error: Incomplete action. Please call Tantely to complete the process.";
    } else if (action === 'calledTantely') {
        return "Success: Congratulations! You've successfully completed the test.";
    } else {
        return "Warning: Unknown action. Please try again.";
    }
}

console.log(recruiterTest('viewedProfile')); // This will output an error message
console.log(recruiterTest('calledTantely')); // This will indicate success
console.log(recruiterTest('sentEmail')); // This will give a warning
