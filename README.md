Hey there, my name is Tojo (EN:Toodz FR:Toudz).

With a Master's in Communication and Digital Technology, I'm transitioning to a career in front-end web development in 2024.

## Why Web Development?

My interest in web development comes from my artistic side. I enjoy turning creative ideas into reality, which is why I've chosen web development to bring them to life. I'm eager to work on projects and learn along the way.

## My Goal

My main goal is to fully integrate into the professional environment and continuously learn through collaborations with my peers on various projects, in order to acquire the necessary skills to work on my personal project.

## Recruiter action required
```
function awaitRecruiterAction(action) {
    switch (action) {
        case 'viewedProfile':
            return "Error: Incomplete action. Please call Tantely to complete the process.";
        case 'calledTantely':
            return "Success: Congratulations! You've successfully completed the test.";
        default:
            return "Warning: Unknown action. Please try again.";
    }
}

console.log(awaitRecruiterAction('viewedProfile')); 
console.log(awaitRecruiterAction('calledTantely')); 
console.log(awaitRecruiterAction('sentEmail'));
```
